  abstract = {In the U.S., Great Britain and in many other countries, the gap between the demand and the supply of human organs for transplantation is on the rise, despite the efforts of governments and health agencies to promote donor registration. In some countries of continental Europe, however, cadaveric organ procurement is based on the principle of presumed consent. Under presumed consent legislation, a deceased individual is classified as a potential donor in absence of explicit opposition to donation before death. This article analyzes the impact of presumed consent laws on donation rates. For this purpose, we construct a dataset on organ donation rates and potential factors affecting organ donation for 22 countries over a 10-year period. We find that while differences in other determinants of organ donation explain much of the variation in donation rates, after controlling for those determinants presumed consent legislation has a positive and sizeable effect on organ donation rates. We use the panel structure of our dataset to test and reject the hypothesis that unmeasured determinants of organ donation rates confound our empirical results.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Clustered standard errors, with clusters defined by factors such as geography, are widespread in empirical research in economics and many other disciplines. Formally, clustered standard errors adjust for the correlations induced by sampling the outcome variable from a data-generating process with unobserved cluster-level components. However, the standard econometric framework for clustering leaves important questions unanswered: (i) Why do we adjust standard errors for clustering in some ways but not others, for example, by state but not by gender, and in observational studies but not in completely randomized experiments? (ii) Is the clustered variance estimator valid if we observe a large fraction of the clusters in the population? (iii) In what settings does the choice of whether and how to cluster make a difference? We address these and other questions using a novel framework for clustered inference on average treatment effects. In addition to the common sampling component, the new framework incorporates a design component that accounts for the variability induced on the estimator by the treatment assignment mechanism. We show that, when the number of clusters in the sample is a nonnegligible fraction of the number of clusters in the population, conventional clustered standard errors can be severely inflated, and propose new variance estimators that correct for this bias.},

  abstract = {In this paper we propose methods for estimating heterogeneity in causal effects in experimental and observational studies and for conducting hypothesis tests about the magnitude of differences in treatment effects across subsets of the population. We provide a data-driven approach to partition the data into subpopulations that differ in the magnitude of their treatment effects. The approach enables the construction of valid confidence intervals for treatment effects, even with many covariates relative to the sample size, and without ``sparsity'' assumptions. We propose an ``honest'' approach to estimation, whereby one sample is used to construct the partition and another to estimate treatment effects for each subpopulation. Our approach builds on regression tree methods, modified to optimize for goodness of fit in treatment effects and to account for honest estimation. Our model selection criterion anticipates that bias will be eliminated by honest estimation and also accounts for the effect of making additional splits on the variance of treatment effect estimates within each subpopulation. We address the challenge that the ``ground truth'' for a causal effect is not observed for any individual unit, so that standard approaches to cross-validation must be modified. Through a simulation study, we show that for our preferred method honest estimation results in nominal coverage for 90\% confidence intervals, whereas coverage ranges between 74\% and 84\% for nonhonest approaches. Honest estimation requires estimating the model with a smaller sample size; the cost in terms of mean squared error of treatment effects for our preferred method ranges between 7--22\%.},

  abstract = {Objectives: To investigate attrition at the finally selected donor stage among British Bone Marrow Registry (BBMR) donors, all recruited from blood donors. Background: The success of searches for unrelated stem cell donors relies on the existence of large international donor registries and the availability of registered donors when matched with a patient. Withdrawal of donors may adversely affect patient outcomes. Materials/Methods: Data on 2942 planned donations were analysed to assess donor-related deferral rates and associated factors. Results: Overall, 20{$\cdot$}2\% of requests were cancelled. Transplant centres activated more than half of the cancellations (52{$\cdot$}6\%). Donor reasons accounted for 46{$\cdot$}7\% of cancellations (9{$\cdot$}4\% of requests), of which 61{$\cdot$}7\% happened for medical and 38{$\cdot$}3\% for personal reasons. Medical ineligibility of the donor was associated with increasing age (odds ratio [OR] = 1{$\cdot$}36, P = 0{$\cdot$}011) and peripheral blood stem cell source (OR = 2{$\cdot$}22, P = 0{$\cdot$}006), and there was some evidence of association with low blood donation reliability (OR = 1{$\cdot$}52, P = 0{$\cdot$}054). The blood donor reliability score relates to blood donation, and the score worsens if donors consistently fail to attend a donation session when invited. Withdrawal on personal grounds showed associations with donor age (OR = 1{$\cdot$}72, P = 0{$\cdot$}017, 30--40 years vs other ages), peripheral blood stem cell source (OR = 2{$\cdot$}43, P = 0{$\cdot$}010) and low blood donor reliability (OR = 1{$\cdot$}94, P = 0{$\cdot$}007). Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first report on all-cause cancellation at the finally-selected donor stage for international stem cell donor provision, showing 9{$\cdot$}4\%},

There are no significant effects on immigrant girls, who exhibit similar choices and performance as native ones in absence of the intervention. Increases in academic motivation and changes in teachers' recommendation regarding high school choice explain a sizable portion of the effect.

Overcoming vaccine hesitancy and failure to follow through on vaccination intentions requires effective communication strategies.

We designed text-based reminders that make vaccination salient and easy, and delivered them to participants drawn from a healthcare system one day (first randomized controlled trial) (n =~93,354~participants; clinicaltrials number NCT04800965) and eight days (second randomized controlled trial) (n =~67,092 individuals; clinicaltrials number NCT04801524) after they received a notification of vaccine eligibility. The first reminder boosted appointment and vaccination rates within the healthcare system by 6.07 (84\%) and 3.57 (26\%) percentage points, respectively; the second reminder increased those outcomes by 1.65 and 1.06 percentage points, respectively. The first reminder had a greater effect when it was designed to make participants feel ownership of the vaccine dose. However, we found no evidence that combining the first reminder with a video-based information intervention designed to address vaccine hesitancy heightened its effect. We performed online studies (n~=~3,181~participants) to examine vaccination intentions, which revealed patterns that diverged from those of the first randomized controlled trial; this underscores the importance of pilot-testing interventions in the field. Our findings inform the design of behavioural nudges for promoting health decisions, and highlight the value of making vaccination easy and inducing feelings of ownership over vaccines.},

Such a result is frequently produced by ``diffusion of responsibility'' as described by Darley and Latan{\'e} (1968). In contrast to other social traps, a dominant strategy does not exist. Also, the mixed-equilibrium strategy yields very low payoffs. The expected gain is not greater than the payoff achieved by the nonequilibrium maximum strategy. Superrationality might be a way out of the trap. However, this concept lacks the desirable equilibrium property.

We found strong polarization, with many participants supporting or opposing payments regardless of potential transplant gains. However, about 18 percent of respondents would switch to favoring payments for sufficiently large increases in transplants. Preferences for compensation have strong moral foundations; participants especially reject direct payments by patients, which they find would violate principles of fairness. We corroborate the interpretation of our findings with a choice experiment of a costly decision to donate money to a foundation that supports donor compensation. (JEL D63, D64, I11)},

  abstract = {Decisions involving charitable giving often occur under the shadow of risk. A common finding is that potential donors give less when there is greater risk that their donation will have less impact. While this behaviour could be fully rationalized by standard economic models, this article shows that an additional mechanism is relevant: the use of risk as an excuse not to give. In a laboratory study, participants evaluate risky payoffs for themselves and risky payoffs for a charity. When their decisions do not involve tradeoffs between money for themselves and the charity, they respond very similarly to self risk and charity risk. By contrast, when their decisions force tradeoffs between money for themselves and the charity, participants act more averse to charity risk and less averse to self risk. These altered responses to risk bias participants towards choosing payoffs for themselves more often, consistent with excuse-driven responses to risk. Additional results support the existence of excuse-driven types.},

However, significant recruitment of female donors continues worldwide and appears to be increasing. In this review, the evidence underlying transplant physician preference for male donor selection is summarized.

Today, large bone marrow registries have been established to help identify volunteer unrelated bone marrow donors for patients lacking a family donor. Despite there being almost 10 million registered potential bone marrow donors (PBMD) worldwide, only 50\% of white patients have a suitable bone marrow match. Growth in the number of PBMD increases the likelihood of finding a compatible donor for a patient. The attitudes and knowledge of 250 registered PBMD and 315 not registered PBMD toward bone marrow donation, tissues and organs donation, and blood donation were surveyed, using a questionnaire with 27 items. Multivariate logistic regression identified gender (females more often than males), regular blood donation, having a relative or a friend who has already been registered as PBMD, having a relative or a friend who needs bone marrow transplantation, family discussion about tissue and organ donation, knowledge about bone marrow transplantation, information about bone marrow transplantation, and trust in health professionals were independent predictive factors influencing people's decision to register as PBMD. Knowledge of these factors is important to target recruitment efforts.},

However, only a very small percentage of parents donate upon delivery. The decision to donate the cord blood occurs at a very specific time and when parents likely experience emotional, informational, and decisional overloads; these features of cord blood donation make it different from other pro-social activities. In collaboration with an OB-GYN clinic in Milan, Italy, we conducted the first randomized controlled trial that applies tools from behavioral science to foster cord blood donation, and quantified the gains that informational and behavioral ``nudges'' can achieve. We found that information and ``soft'' commitments increased donations; approaching expecting parents closer to the delivery date and providing them with multiple reminders, moreover, had the strongest impact. However, a significant portion of women who expressed consent to donate could not do so because of organizational constraints. We conclude that simple, non-invasive behavioral interventions that address information gaps and procrastination, and that increase the salience of the activity can substantially enhance altruistic donations of cord blood, especially when coupled with organizational support.},

We analyzed 91,670 confirmatory typing requests to registry members for whom a matching patient was found. We find that initiatives are robustly associated with lower attrition through both sorting and behavioral channels. Our preferred estimates indicate that the initiatives are associated with between 4.0 and 8.5 percentage-point lower attrition, corresponding to 17.5\% to 37.1\% reduced unavailability to donate. Moreover, the decision of donors to engage in an initiative is predictive of their propensity for attrition at the CT stage. We discuss implications for stem-cell registries in terms of operational efficiency, notably their ability to use participation in the initiatives as a signal of higher eventual availability to donate, as well as costs and benefits.},

To address the causes of the market failure, we conduct a field experiment with volunteer whole blood donors where we introduce a market-clearing mechanism (henceforth: the Registry). Our intention-to-treat estimates suggest that subjects invited to the Registry, regardless of joining, are 66\% more responsive to critical shortage appeals than control subjects. While the Registry increases supply during a critical shortage episode, it does not increase supply when there is no shortage; thus, the Registry significantly improves coordination between volunteer donors and collection centers, thereby improving market outcomes. We find evidence that the Registry's effectiveness stems from crowding-in volunteers with purely altruistic motives and volunteers with a preference for commitment.},

Two hundred and three patients received allo-HSCT from JMDP donors (Group A) with a median of 140 days required to identify a donor, 60 received allo-HSCT from alternative sources (Group B) after a median of 111.5 days at which point either all donor candidates had failed or the patient achieved a second or subsequent complete remission, and 77 suspended allo-HSCT (Group C) after a median of 310 days. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate in Group A was superior to that of Group C (48.6 vs 38.5\%, P = 0.001). Although Group B included more patients with high or very high disease risk index (DRI) at the time of allo-HSCT compared with Group A, the 5-year OS was not significantly different between Groups A and B (48.6 vs 40.9\%, P = 0.07), indicating that switching to alternative donors may benefit patients with high DRI.},

The experiment includes treatments across different default choices and organ allocation rules inspired by the donor registration systems applied in different countries. Our results indicate that the opt-out with priority rule system generates the largest increase in organ donation relative to an opt-in only program. However, sizeable gains are achievable using either a priority rule or opt-out program separately, with the opt-out rule generating approximately 80\% of the benefits achieved under a priority rule program.},

  abstract = {The analysis of data from experiments in economics routinely involves testing multiple null hypotheses simultaneously. These different null hypotheses arise naturally in this setting for at least three different reasons: when there are multiple outcomes of interest and it is desired to determine on which of these outcomes a treatment has an effect; when the effect of a treatment may be heterogeneous in that it varies across subgroups defined by observed characteristics and it is desired to determine for which of these subgroups a treatment has an effect; and finally when there are multiple treatments of interest and it is desired to determine which treatments have an effect relative to either the control or relative to each of the other treatments. In this paper, we provide a bootstrap-based procedure for testing these null hypotheses simultaneously using experimental data in which simple random sampling is used to assign treatment status to units. Using the general results in Romano and Wolf (Ann Stat 38:598--633, 2010), we show under weak assumptions that our procedure (1) asymptotically controls the familywise error rate---the probability of one or more false rejections---and (2) is asymptotically balanced in that the marginal probability of rejecting any true null hypothesis is approximately equal in large samples. Importantly, by incorporating information about dependence ignored in classical multiple testing procedures, such as the Bonferroni and Holm corrections, our procedure has much greater ability to detect truly false null hypotheses. In the presence of multiple treatments, we additionally show how to exploit logical restrictions across null hypotheses to further improve power. We illustrate our methodology by revisiting the study by Karlan and List (Am Econ Rev 97(5):1774--1793, 2007) of why people give to charitable causes.},

Careful donor selection is an important component of the clinical transplantation decision-making process and includes evaluation of HLA typing and other criteria, the most controversial of which is parity. We examined the effect of donor sex and parity on outcomes of HLA-identical sibling SCT. Because the effect of recipient sex/parity has never been explicitly evaluated, we also analyzed the effect of recipient sex/parity on outcomes of transplantation. We found that (1) parous female donors result in an increased risk of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in all recipients, (2) the magnitude of this increased risk is similar in male and female recipients, and (3) nulliparous female donors increase the risk of chronic GVHD in male recipients to a degree comparable to that from parous donors. A decrease in the risk of relapse was not observed, and there was no effect on overall survival, acute GVHD, or transplant-related mortality. Recipient parity had no independent effect on any endpoint. Until the effects of pregnancy on the maternal immune system are better understood, it is appropriate whenever possible to avoid parous female donors and to choose male donors for male recipients in HLA-identical related donor SCT.},

Our findings suggest that text messages sent prior to a primary care visit can boost vaccination rates by an average of 5\%. Overall, interventions performed better when they were 1) framed as reminders to get flu shots that were already reserved for the patient and 2) congruent with the sort of communications patients expected to receive from their healthcare provider (i.e., not surprising, casual, or interactive). The best-performing intervention in our study reminded patients twice to get their flu shot at their upcoming doctor's appointment and indicated it was reserved for them. This successful script could be used as a template for campaigns to encourage the adoption of life-saving vaccines, including against COVID-19.},

We retrospectively analyzed 225 cases of allogeneic HSCT and showed that FtoM mismatch confers a highly significant impact on OS (P {$<$} 0.005) in Japanese population. We demonstrated that this effect depends on the disease risk; for standard risk cases, this effect was significantly associated with poor outcome (for OS, P = 0.021), while for high risk cases, it had no effect on the results (for OS, P = 0.26). We further showed that FtoM mismatch was associated with nonrelapse mortality (P = 0.019) and most of them were GVHD-related in standard risk cases. In conclusion, FtoM mismatch has a significant impact on transplant outcome, especially in standard risk cases.},

Some empirical evidence suggests that costly, laborintensive educational programs and mass-media campaigns might increase registrations; however, they are neither scalable nor economical solutions. To address these limitations, the authors conducted a field experiment (N {$\frac{1}{4}$} 3,330) in Ontario, Canada, testing the effectiveness of behaviorally informed promotion interventions as well as process improvements. They find that intercepting customers with materials targeting information and altruistic motives at the right time, along with streamlining customer service, significantly increased registrations. Specifically, the best-performing intervention, prompting perspective taking through reciprocal altruism (``If you needed a transplant would you have one?''), significantly increased new registration rates from 4.1\% in the control condition to 7.4\%. The authors followed up with seven posttests (total N {$\frac{1}{4}$} 3,376) to find support for their theoretical predictions and to explore the mechanisms through which the interventions may have operated. This article provides evidence for low-cost, scalable marketing solutions that increase organ donor registrations in a prompted choice context and has important implications for public policy and societal welfare.},

  abstract = {Background: A shortage of organs available for transplantation is causing loss of life. Increasing the number of individuals on the National Health Service (NHS) Organ Donor Register (ODR) is one way to address the shortage of organs. In Great Britain, new drivers registering for their driving licence are invited to join the ODR. A further 17 million drivers renew their road tax online each year, presenting an additional opportunity to prompt drivers to join the ODR. This trial explores the effect of adding persuasive messages to a prompt to join the ODR at the end of road tax payment transactions. Methods: In this pragmatic, parallel group, quasi-randomised controlled trial, drivers renewing their road tax or registering for a driving licence were alternately allocated, using a JavaScript randomisation code embedded in the GOV.UK website, to view a control prompt inviting sign-ups to the ODR or the same prompt plus one of seven theoretically informed persuasive messages; (i) social norms alone, (ii) social norms plus the NHS ODR logo, (iii) social norms plus an image, (iv) loss frame, (v) gain frame, (vi) reciprocity and (vii) cognitive dissonance. The trial took place over a 4-week period in June 2013. The primary outcome measure was participants completing the online registration form (sign-ups). Results: Altogether, 1,085,322 website users were included in the study. Further, 1171 more sign-ups were completed under the most effective message (reciprocity) compared to the control prompt alone (reciprocity: n = 4256, control: n = 3085; odds ratio, OR 1.38, 95\% confidence interval 1.32--1.45, p {$<$} 0.001). The loss-framed message was as effective. All messages increased sign-ups compared to the control prompt apart from the social norms message plus image (n = 2879; OR 0.94, 95\% confidence interval 0.89--0.99, p {$<$} 0.05). Conclusions: Short persuasive messages alongside a prompt can persuade more ODR sign-ups for individuals renewing their road tax than a prompt alone. The most effective message remains in place today. Since the trial in 2013, the same message has been implemented across 25 government end-of-transaction websites on GOV.UK, resulting in 529,000 new registrations to the ODR up to 31st October 2017.},

In 2008, Israel's Parliament passed an Organ Transplantation Law granting priority on organ donor waiting lists to individuals who had previously registered as organ donors. Beginning in November 2010, public awareness campaigns advertised the priority policy to the public. Since April 2012, priority has been added to the routine medical criteria in organ allocation decisions. We evaluate the introduction of priority for registered organ donors using Israeli data on organ donor registration from 1992 to 2013. We find that registrations increased when information about the priority law was made widely available. We find an even larger increase in registration rates in the 2 months leading up to a program deadline, after which priority would only be granted with a 3-year delay. We also find that the registration rate responds positively to public awareness campaigns, to the ease of registration (i.e. allowing for registering online and by phone) and to an election drive that included placing registration opportunities in central voting locations.

In this paper, we study two non-price methods that are often used to alleviate shortage for human blood. The first method is informing existing donors of a current shortage via a mobile message and encouraging them to donate voluntarily. The second method is asking the patient's family or friends to donate in a family replacement (FR) program at the time of shortage. Using 447,357 individual donation records across 8 years from a large Chinese blood bank, we show that both methods are effective in addressing blood shortage in the short run but have different implications for total blood supply in the long run. We compare the efficacy of these methods and discuss their applications under different scenarios to alleviate shortage.},

Due in part to successful recruitment and the longevity of the registry, the focus of the NMDP has now shifted to decreasing potential attrition when volunteers are recontacted for additional testing to determine whether they would be the optimal donor for a specific patient. Our own interest in the bone marrow donation process led us to examine four domains of variables -- demographic characteristics, volunteer history, recruitment-related characteristics and donationrelated concerns -- that we hypothesized would be associated with increased likelihood of donor attrition at a key donor decision-point (DR-stage blood typing). Questionnaires were mailed to potential donors after they were contacted at the DR-stage, and had made the decision of whether or not to continue with blood typing. Our final sample included 756 volunteers who decided to continue with typing, and 258 individuals who declined further participation in the registry. In the bivariate analyses, factors in three of the four domains (all except demographic characteristics) were found to be substantially correlated with likelihood of attrition. Logistic regression indicated that nine central variables across the three domains produced the majority of increased attrition likelihood. Finally, a dose-response analysis suggested that as the number of attrition-related factors endorsed by an individual increased, his/her likelihood of dropping out of the registry also increased. Implications for future research and interventions to reduce potential donor attrition are discussed.},

  abstract = {Background. The National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) has had remarkable success at recruiting potential bone marrow donors and recently has become increasingly focused on the retention of registered volunteers. This study extends the authors' work examining factors associated with attrition from the registry. Its goal was to determine which characteristics from six psychosocial domains were associated with attrition at two key stages leading to donation. Methods. Questionnaires were mailed to potential donors after they were contacted as a potential match and had decided whether or not to continue toward donation. Our final sample included 1,727 volunteers who decided to continue with typing at the DR stage and 195 volunteers who decided to continue at the confirmatory typing (CT) stage as well as 179 and 169 individuals, respectively, who declined further participation in the registry at DR and CT stages. Results. Bivariate analyses indicated that multiple factors in all six domains (demographics, volunteerrelated, general psychosocial, recruitment-related, donation-related, and contact with center staff) were associated with discontinued registry participation. Logistic regression indicated that unique associations were concentrated in volunteer-related, donation-related, and contact with center domains. Conclusions. Findings suggested that intrinsic commitment to donation, more realistic expectations, fewer medical concerns, and greater contact with the donor center were all associated with lower attrition. Possible interventions to reduce attrition are discussed.},

  abstract = {Patients with blood-related diseases often cannot identify a matched related donor and must seek donors in unrelated donor registries. These registries face the challenge of ensuring that potential donors are available when contacted. Donor attrition is especially problematic when there is only a single perfectly matched potential donor. One way to improve donor availability might be to present perfectly matched donors (high-priority donors [HPDs]) with more precise information about their match status. This project evaluated the impact of providing such information to HPDs at the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP)/Be The Match. Objectives were to determine the acceptability of the new messaging to both HPDs and the donor contact representatives (DCRs) who delivered the message, consistency of message delivery, and whether the new messaging was associated with improved donor availability. Mixed methods were used to collect telephone interview data from HPDs, matched samples of non-HPDs, and DCRs. Donor availability data came from NMDP records. Key findings were as follows: (1) the HPD message was acceptable to potential donors and did not seem to produce undue pressure, (2) the message was acceptable to DCRs who became more comfortable and consistent in delivering the message over time, but (3) the new messaging did not significantly increase availability. Despite the lack of evidence for increased availability, there may be ethical benefits and little harm to providing well-matched donors with more information about their degree of matching. Research should examine stronger match status messages and delivery of new messaging to additional highly-matched donor groups.},

  abstract = {Many scientific and engineering challenges---ranging from personalized medicine to customized marketing recommendations---require an understanding of treatment effect heterogeneity. In this article, we develop a nonparametric causal forest for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects that extends Breiman's widely used random forest algorithm. In the potential outcomes framework with unconfoundedness, we show that causal forests are pointwise consistent for the true treatment effect and have an asymptotically Gaussian and centered sampling distribution. We also discuss a practical method for constructing asymptotic confidence intervals for the true treatment effect that are centered at the causal forest estimates. Our theoretical results rely on a generic Gaussian theory for a large family of random forest algorithms. To our knowledge, this is the first set of results that allows any type of random forest, including classification and regression forests, to be used for provably valid statistical inference. In experiments, we find causal forests to be substantially more powerful than classical methods based on nearest-neighbor matching, especially in the presence of irrelevant covariates.},

We use this fact, together with the assumption that blood types are exogenously assigned by nature, to design an empirical inquiry into altruism. We also investigate the timing of donations, especially focussing on the behaviour of new and established donors. We show that O-negative blood donors donate no more often than other people. Thus individuals apparently do not exhibit pure altruism. We speculate that instead blood donors may be driven by a broad notion of duty rather than by a far-sighted, rational unselfishness.},

We attribute the cause to social effects: contributors receive social benefits that increase with both the amount of their contributions and group size, and the shrinking group size weakens these social benefits. Consistent with our explanation, we find that the more contributors value social benefits, the more they reduce their contributions after the block. (JEL H41, L17, L82)},
